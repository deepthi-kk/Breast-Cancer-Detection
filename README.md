Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Attribute Information:

* ID number
* Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

## Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

* radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
* texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* perimeter
* area
* smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
* compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
* concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry
* fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
